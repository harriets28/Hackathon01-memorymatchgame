Simple Memory Match Game - Javascript
This is a Memory Match Game fabricated with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript. The website is easy to navigate and is visually appealing to incite interest from participants. In this simple Memory Match Game project, the game utilised some of the more intermediate advanced parts of the Document Object Model or the Javascript DOM to highlight how to build this web application.

The Memory Match game developed by the group relied on simple mechanics and durable, consistent components. The core "must-haves" ensured scalability and engagement for players of all ages. The core "should-haves" ensured the backs of the cards were completely identical, with no markings, scratches, or wear that allow players to identify them. The "could-haves" included using cards with educational and interactive themes and using a time limit to increase difficulty.

## Must-Haves
Essential Gameplay Elements
Simple Instructions: The instructions are easy to understand: match a pair of cards to win.
Scalability: The game allows for selecting difficulty by clicking "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" using fewer or more pairs, making it suitable for different ages.
Immediate Feedback: If a match is not made, the cards flip back over in the same spot, allowing players to remember their location.
Turn Mechanics: If a player makes a match, they should be rewarded with a congratulatory message . 
Uniform Size: All cards are resized to the exact same size to avoid identifying them by shape.
Identical Pair Pictures: Used online pictures to create two identical images for each pair.
Identical Card Backs: To ensure interesting gameplay, the backs of the cards are identical so no card can be identified while face down.
Use of buttons: Buttons are included to allow frequent clicking and handling, especially by children.
Clear, Distinct Imagery: Images are easy to distinguish from one another to help with recognition and memory.
