Simple Memory Match Game - Javascript
The project purpose was to devise a Memory Match Game fabricated with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & JavaScript. For debugging the code, Python Debugger extension was utilised. The outcome was a website that is easy to navigate and is visually appealing to incite interest from participants. In this simple Memory Match Game project, the game utilised some of the more intermediate to advanced parts of Document Object Model or the Javascript DOM to highlight how to build this web application.

The Memory Match game developed by the group relied on simple mechanics and durable, consistent components. The core "must-haves" ensured scalability and engagement for players of all ages. The core "should-haves" ensured the backs of the cards were completely identical, with no markings, scratches, or wear that allow players to identify them. The "could-haves" included using cards with educational and interactive themes.

## Deployment of the Project
Deploying a building-block HTML application—ranging from simple fixed pages to complex single-page applications (SPAs) follows a structured workflow that transitions code from four local environments owned by each group member to a live server accessible via a domain. The group followed GitHub command lines using VS Code to push information to a main branch in GitHub. The main branch was owned by one individual to accept changes before the rest of the group pull in the most up to date information to local folders. Work was monitored using a project`s Issues Template GitHub. The Project Template on GitHub highlights "To do", "In-Progress" and "Done" User Stories of the Memory Match Card Game. Preparation and build stages before deployment ensured that the application was "production-ready". The webpage was deployed through GitHub Pages, an accessible website that is free-of-charge and straightforward for hosting directly from a repository. The webpage was deployed on Day 3.

### Project Must-Haves
Essential Gameplay Elements
Simple Instructions: The instructions are easy to understand: match a pair of cards to win.
Scalability: The game allows for selecting difficulty by clicking "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" using fewer or more pairs, making it suitable for different ages.
Immediate Feedback: If a match is not made, the cards flip back over in the same spot, allowing players to remember their location.
Turn Mechanics: If a player makes a match, they should be rewarded with a congratulatory message . 
Uniform Size: All cards are resized to the exact same size to avoid identifying them by shape.
Identical Pair Pictures: Use of online pictures to create two identical images for each pair.
Identical Card Backs: To ensure interesting gameplay, the backs of the cards are identical such that cards are unidentifiable while face down.
Use of buttons: Buttons are included to allow frequent clicking and handling, especially by children.
Clear and Distinct Imagery: Images are easy to distinguish from one another to help with recognition and memory.

#### Project Should-Haves
Identical Backs: The most important rule is that all cards must look identical on the back to prevent identifying specific cards while face down.
Distinct Sets: Every single image have an exact duplicate to form a pair. For more complexity, sets of four my be used.
High-Contrast, Clear Images: Especially for children or seniors, images are bright, clear, and easy to distinguish from one another such as animals, fruits and people.
Sufficient Count: The starting point imay be even be an increased number of pairs such as 12–24 pairs (24–48 cards), adjusted for difficulty. 
Clear Setup Rules: The cards are shuffled and laid out face down in a random pattern.
Turn Structure: Instructions dictate flipping two cards per turn, with the ability to keep them if they match.

##### Project Could-Haves
None Matching Cards: Include one or two cards that do not have a pair, forcing players to recall which cards to avoid.
Card Rotation: Every n moves, the cards reshuffle, changing their perspective on the board.
Timed Moves: Use of a timer to add urgency to the game. 
Use of customised pictures: Personalising the game using photos of family, friends, pets, and/or travel locations.
Customising the reverse side of the cards to match the theme such as character art and colors.
Size Variation: Use of oversized visual cards for young children for ease of identification. 
Educational Sets: Use of cards to teach numbers, letters and shapes along with use of high-quality illustrations of animals and plants.
Patient Memory Care: Use of high-contrast images with large fonts specifically designed for elderly patients to support cognitive function.
Pop Culture: Feature, for example, Marvel characters, to make it more appealing to children. 
Online Customising Editor: Use an online editor to upload images, choose themes, and preview the deck before publishing online.
App Integration: Combining with a companion app that tracks high scores or provides a timer, and using a time limit to increase difficulty.. 


###### Features
The Memory Match Game can be played by one player at a time.
To get the Memory Match Game correct and win, Users locate and match all pairs of the cards.
Cards are arranged facing down in a grid in 8s, 12s and 16s in accordance with difficulty.
Every single card included had a distinct, matching counterpart with clear and contrasting images.
Users can turn cards by clicking a button to view images in attempt to find a matching pair.
The turned cards remain open for the duration of the Memory Match Game.
Users should recall the images from last turns through memory-driven mechanics.
